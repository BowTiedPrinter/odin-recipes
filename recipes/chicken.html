      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These buttermilk chicken strips are crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside!</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 ½ pounds chicken tenders</li>
          <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
          <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon garlic salt</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons mustard powder</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
          <li>2 cups peanut oil, or as needed</li>
          <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Soak chicken tenders in buttermilk for 20 to 30 minutes in the refrigerator.</li>
          <li>While chicken is soaking, combine flour, salt, garlic salt, mustard powder, paprika, and pepper in a large brown bag.</li>
          <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
          <li>Drain chicken and shake lightly to remove excess buttermilk. Chicken should still be damp. Drop chicken into the bag of seasoned flour and shake until well coated.</li>
          <li>Drop chicken into hot oil, about 6 pieces at a time, depending on the size of your pot. Cook until golden brown, crispy, and no longer pink in the centers, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from oil and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and pepper while still warm.</li>
        </ol>
